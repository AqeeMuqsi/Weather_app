# ✅ FIXED: Real-Time Weather on City Search

**Developer: Aqeela**

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### Problem:
When searching for a city, the app was showing weather for the searched city but forecast data for your current GPS location (wrong!).

### Solution:
Now when you search for ANY city:
1. ✅ **Real-time current weather** for that city loads immediately
2. ✅ **7-day forecast** for that city (not your location!)
3. ✅ **24-hour forecast** for that city
4. ✅ **All weather details** (sunrise, sunset, wind, etc.) for that city
5. ✅ **Weather by Date** feature works for searched city

## 📱 **How to Test**

### Test Real-Time Search:

1. **Open the app** on Chrome
2. **Click Search icon** (🔍) in top-right
3. **Type a city name** (e.g., "Tokyo", "London", "Paris")
4. **Click Search**
5. **Watch it load!**

**You should see:**
- ✅ Tokyo's current weather (temperature, condition)
