# 🌍 How to Enable GPS/Location in Chrome

## **The Problem:**
Your SkyWatch app is trying to get your GPS location, but Chrome browser hasn't been given permission yet!

---

## ✅ **Solution 1: Enable Location in Chrome (BEST for real GPS)**

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Open Chrome** where your app is running

2. **Click the Lock icon** 🔒 (or Info icon ℹ️) in address bar
   - It's on the LEFT side of the URL

3. **Find "Location"** in the dropdown
   
4. **Change to "Allow"**
   - Click on Location
   - Select "Allow"

5. **Refresh the page** (F5 or reload button)

6. **Your real GPS location will now work!** 🎉

---

## ✅ **Solution 2: Use Default City (EASIER for testing)**

The app will automatically use **London** as default if GPS fails.

**This is already working!** Just:
1. Go to Home screen
2. Wait for it to load London's weather
3. Then use "Weather by Date" feature

---

## 📱 **For Mobile/Android Testing**

If you build the APK and install on your phone:
1. Location will work automatically
2. Just grant permission when asked
3. Real GPS will give you local weather!

## 🔧 **Quick Fix: Force Load Default City**

I'll make the app load London weather immediately when it opens, so you don't have to wait for GPS!
